Morning and full-night measurements are the two reliable ways to measure HRV. Stressors such as alcohol, training, food, etc. can acutely impact resting physiology. HRV4Training integrates with standard sensors and the Oura ring to capture rMSSD values, which are transformed into a score between 5 and 10. It is important to note that HRV data is highly individual and has high day-to-day variability, so it should not be compared to others and should not be interpreted as \"higher is better\". HRV4Training does the math to analyze how training and lifestyle impact our physiology.",

              "output": "HRV data should be used as a continuous feedback loop to improve health and performance. It is important to determine a normal range to easily establish if a change in HRV is meaningful, and to analyze both acute changes (in response to strong stressors) and medium to long-term trends (in response to larger stressors). Training shifts the autonomic nervous system towards a sympathetic drive, which is reflected in higher HR and lower HRV. Context is key when it comes to HRV monitoring, and subjective metrics and objective data should be taken into account when interpreting the data. HRV should be looked at in relation to the stressors, and contextualized with other factors such as travel, subjective parameters, training load, and normal range.",
