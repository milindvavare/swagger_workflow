                ":\n\nCause and Effect: \n1. SePaL's self-supervised prototype representation learning framework enables the generation of dynamic corporate profiles that can be fine-tuned for downstream applications - this allows for the identification of the evolving corporate status to benefit various financial applications.\n\nSimilarity: \n2. SePaL and existing studies on corporate profiling both aim to assess the operational status of a corporate from its event sequence.\n\nDifference: \n3. SePaL utilizes the topological information of an event graph and explores self-supervised learning techniques to obtain unified corporate representations, while existing studies partially address the problem via case-by-case empirical analysis or automatic profile inference.\n\nPotential Implication: \n4. The use of permutation-invariant self-supervision signals in SePaL helps maintain the consistency of prototype selections from long event sequences.\n\nOpportunities: \n5. SePaL can be used for various applications such as stock price spike prediction and corporate default risk evaluation.\n\nHierarchical: \n6. SePaL is composed of four components - event graph, prototype representation learning, permutation-invariant self-supervision signals, and time-evolving corporate representations - which work together to generate unified corporate representations that are robust to event noises.\n\nProblem-Solution: \n7. SePaL is able to address the issue of corporate profiling by leveraging traditional financial methods and reformulating the problem into a supervised learning task.\n\nCorrelational: \n8. The experimental results demonstrate that SePaL outperforms all other baselines on both datasets using all metrics, indicating that event prototypes may achieve better understandings in discovering event-based sequential patterns."

                "Cause-Effect:\n1. SePaL is a self-supervised prototype representation learning framework for event-based corporate profiling which generates the cluster distribution of event prototypes based on an event graph and proposes four permutation-invariant supervision signals to learn the noise-resistance prototype embeddings, resulting in the re-encoded prototype sequence as dynamic corporate profile which can be fine-tuned with the temporal model for downstream applications.\n2.
